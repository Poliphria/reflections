When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

  Using a remote repository makes it easier to collaborate with others and
   for when you switch between desktop and laptop. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Automatic pulls create a security risk if someone can automatically alters code. 
  Automatic also might mess up what you are working on. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

  Branches are for when you want to make changes to a local repository but not 
  on the main (master) branch of the code. You would use this if you want to 
  try an experimental feature. Clones are used when you want to grab an existing
  repository on github with a commit (include the README.md file on github) and
  copy it to your local machine. Use this when you want to grab from github to laptop.
  Forks are when you want to give credit to someone before you make changes on github 
  and copy their repository to your GitHub account.
